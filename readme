Search the content of any (browser supported) local video using its subrip(.srt) file

A .srt file with the same name as the video should exist in the 'uploadpath' folder.
You can select and upload the .srt file using the file input widget.

supported browsers - chrome and firefox

To get this working in chrome,start chrome with flag --allow-file-access-from-files

.mp4,.webm,.ogv works in chrome
.webm,.ogv works with firefox

possible bugs:
To read the srt file ,the code uses utf-8-sig codec 
(http://docs.python.org/library/codecs.html#module-encodings.utf_8_sig)
This is to deal with the BOM in the .srt files which I created using Google2SRT java program.
Will implement a generic reader function ,when I get time.
